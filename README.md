# Local.dev
[![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbeldame/local.dev/master/demo.gif)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbeldame/local.dev/master/_demo.mp4)

Local.dev offers you a simple command line to improve your node workflow.

Did you already struggled to remember all of those localhost:port that you juste create ? Or don't you want to rename the boring localhost:8080 to whatever.dev ? Because I did !

With local.dev, you can rename any localhost:port to any name possible, you don't even need to add a domain dot if you don't feel like it.
